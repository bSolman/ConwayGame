# ConwayGame
The project implements Conwell's Game of Life algorithm. Agreed it's not the fastest implementation, but at least it's readable. I hope.
To run the program either download the full repo and import it to your favourite IDE with maven support. 
Or grab the .jar file under /out/artifacts/conwaysgame/ConwaysGame.jar 
and run it on a computer with Java installed on it.
